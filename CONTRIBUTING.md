# Contributing to ProteoNeMo
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible.

## Pull Requests
We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.

Consult [GitHub Help](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) for more information on using pull requests.

We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted.  This leads to **more
readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**.  But also,
we use the git commit messages to **generate the Angular change log**.

## Commit Message Format
Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.  The header has a special format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier
to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

The footer should contain a [closing reference to an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) if any.

Samples: (even more [samples](https://github.com/angular/angular/commits/master))

```
docs(changelog): update changelog to beta.5
```
```
fix(release): need to depend on latest python version
The version in our version.py gets copied in setup.py, and users need the latest of these.
```

### Revert
If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

### Type
Must be one of the following:

* **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
* **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
* **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

### Scope
The scope should be the name of the python package affected. [Here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) are some examples.
